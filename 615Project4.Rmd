![Matrix of Frequency and Severity](Pict2.png)


No matter the origine or the type of disruptions ,the result could be expressed in term of loss of one of those capcities from the company standpoint:

Capacity to acquire material(raw material from suppliers)

Capacity to ship or transport(which can increase the lead time and the responsiveness of the chain)

Human ressources

Financial flows (big loss in return or values,issues with continuity in the business)

#4. Preparing and handling a disruption

###4.1-Preparation 

The company should have a plan in place 

###4.2-Disruptive event occurs

Take note

###4.3-First Response

company should try to deliver first aid response

###4.4-Initial impact 

assess initial impact

###4.5-Time of full impact

###4.6-Recovery preparation

###4.7-Recovery 

###4.8-Longterm impact assessment 


#5. Risk management Framework 

###5.1.vulnerability assessment
a.

Mapping the supply chain through visualization of all the nodes
locating and knowing the upstream tiers 1,2,3 & downstream to customers

b.

Analyzing the sources of risk 

* Natural disasters predictability by region (even by season if possible)

* Terrorism :threat adjusts to prevention(what could be at great risk and where in the supply chain)

* Labor unrest:threat often adjusts to preventive actions

* Suppliers failure : requires close monitoring (monitoring the financial health of your tiers)

c.

Risk analytics: quantitative and qualitative:

* Assess probabilities of disruptions

* Assess impact and consequences of disruption

* Issues : data hard to collect for forecasting and assessment


###5.2.Mitigation planning and implementation

Identify  options for reducing probabilities and impacts(consequences)

Identify the company risk profile

Choose the right mix of each for the business

choose between prevention or response :how much of each

Reducing Probability :security and prevention

Reducing Impacts :response and resilience


###5.3.Ongoing Monitoring and Measurement

Design and install monitoring  system 

Global event monitoring :geographic,political,weather

Supplier operational and financial health

Monitoring the entire network  find all the sources

Install measurement systems

* Leadtime

* Time to recover(TTR):number of days or weeks to restore 100% operational output following a  supply disruption

* Set targets and use flexibility and redundancy to hit target

Mapping the supply chain risk network

Maintaining suppliers databases


###5.4.Crisis Management & Response

Develop response playbooks

Impact analysis:

on customers ,facility and products

Create ,train emergency response teams accross all components of the company(sales,marketing,security,legal,finance)

create protocols for communication


#6.Mathematical modeling and analysis


We assume that the company has manufacturing locations named Nm( usually $N_{m}$ is small $\leq 25$  and we assume that warehouses and distribution centers are include in this number) and Ns( number of stores usually for a globally present company $N_{s}$> 1000 locations as selling points(Stores).
Total number of locations $$Nm +Ns = N$$
We will assume also that rational behavior is put into place in a sense that where there are more resources, more safety measures are in place and where there are less resources less safety measure are in place.

So we can assume for simplicity that the overall aggregate probability(the chance )of taking a loss for the company at any given place in the chain comes from the same distribution or process.We can also argue that a company will not take a chance to open a location if it perceives that location to be more riskier(financially or weather wise or any type of risk associate to it) than it current locations.

In most cases a global presence is achieved over a long period of time specially garments retailer ,so we assume that company A has some past data where we can make use of it to estimate the parameters of the distribution or the process that derive from the supply chain modeling.

Time series data from the company could be used to record the number of major issues at a particular location and the impact of on the location.
We can  then calculate the time to recovery and other useful metrics 




###6.1 Modeling the time and the type of events in the supply chain using Markov Chain

We can use many techniques to model the supply chain


Here we use a Markov chain modeling:

Unlike other papers we use a new approach inspired from insurance claims modeling!

Our goal is to give Managers a time frame of events most likely to follow to help make better decisions.

Even though we could model each location by using a Markov chain ,we decided to use it on the entire chain "state" as one entity:
For this we suppose that two events can't happen exactly at same time in the chain:example 2 stores can't be open(join the chain) at the same time but rather one after another ,2 disruptions don't start at the  same time.... 

We suppose locations and events to be homogenious and independents so the Poisson process(number of events) and exponential(time until the next event) assumptions are well grounded:

We suppose that locations open(join the supply chain according to a poisson process at a rate $v$, the rate is estimated based on the company past data)

Each location remained joined(without disruption) for an amount of time that is exponentially distributed with rate $\mu$ and then get disrupted.

Independtly each location get an impact( a loss due to various risks )according to a poisson process at a rate of $\lambda$

all impact sizes are iid with same distribution (estimating this distribution based on past data)



At any given time t we have N locations=$N_{m} + N_{s}$.

Starting from time t let the ramdom varaible $X_{1}$ denote the time until a new location is open ,

$X_{2}$ the time until of the current location get a disruption(major issue happen),

$X_{3}$ the time when there is a loss reported on the  chain value.
Then by the Poisson/exponential assumptions of memoryless property of the exponential distribution ,these 3 ramdom variables are independent and exponentially distributed:

$X_{1}$ ~ $exp(v)$,

$X_{2}$ ~$exp(N\mu)$,

$X_{3}$ ~ $exp(N\lambda)$

$X_{1}$: is obvious as it is the time until the next event from the Poisson rate $v$ process

$X_{2}$: There are N locations, each independently with their own opening(joining)time " $Y_{1}, . . . , Y_{N}$ exponential at rate $\mu$. 

Thus $X_{2}$ = min{$Y_{1},...,Y_{N}$}, 

which is exponential at rate $N\mu$ because $P(X_{2} > x) = P(Y_{1} > x,...,Y_{N}> x)$ = $P(Y > x)^{N} = exp(-N\mu x)$.

Similar to $X_{2}$;$X_{3}$ ~ $exp(N\lambda)$ since it is the minimum of N iid $exp(\lambda)$ rvs
 
So in conclusion we can model this supply chain behavior overtime as  a markov chain with 3 types of events types”

***S1: a new location joins the chain***
 
***S2: an existing location get disrupted(no more used on the chain,this location may return to state S1 in the chain) ***
 
***S3: a loss is reported (added) on the chain(this loss comes from various risks).*** 
  
The time until the next event is the minimum 

m = min{$X_{1}$,$X_{2}$,$X_{3}$}, 
hence is itself exponentially distributed with rate r=$v+N\mu+N\lambda$ the sum of the three rates.

Thus if the current time is t and there are N locations, then we can predict the “next event” at time 
$$t+(-(1/r)ln(U).(0<U<1)$$

To determine the type  of event it is: Noting that each of $X_{1}$, $X_{2}$ or$X_{3}$  will be the minimum with probabilities $p_{1} = v/r$, $p_{2} = N\mu/r$, $p_{3} = N\lambda/r$, we conclude that we simply need to independently generate a rv C with distribution

$P(C = 1) = p_{1}$, $P(C = 2) = p-{2}$, $P(C = 3)=p_{3}$;

then if C=i we conclude that the event is of type Si. 

Generate U. 

If $U\leq p_{1}$,then set C=1 

If $p_{1} < U \leq p_{1} + p_{2}$, then set C = 2. 

If U > $p_{1}+p_{2}$, then set C = 3


###Algorithm of the above model

1.t=0,R=x,$N=n_{0}>0$,$\tau=\infty$,I=0,M=0.

2.Generate U 

3.Set =r=v+(-1/r)ln(U),$p_{1}=v/r$,$p_{2}=N\mu/r$,$p_{3}=N*\lambda/r$

4.t=t+(-1/r)ln(U)

5.if t>T stop

6.R=R+cN(-1/r)ln(U)

7.Generate C between 1 ,2 and 3

8.$P(C=1)=p_{1},P(C=2)=p_{2},P(C=3)=p_{3}$

9.if C=1,then N=N+1

10.if C=2, then N=N-1

11.if C=3,then generate B~G

12.Set R=R-B

13.if R$\leq 0$ ,then set I=1,set $\tau=t$,set M=|R| and stop

14.Goto 2.

***See the implementation of this algorithm below in the simualtion section***


###6.2 Modeling the total risk on the chain using Aggregate loss

In Section we turn our attention to the severity of the risk and the frequency of the events.
We use aggregate loss models to frame our problem in a defined period T,the aggregate loss in the chain can be model using Individual risk model or Collective risk model,below are the descriptions:


Aggregate loss: total amount of loss in one period:

* Individual risk model
* Collective risk model

***Individual risk model:*** is a model where we study the aggregate risk(loss) $S = X_{1} +....+ X_{n}$ where the risks(losses) {$X_{1},...., X_{n}$} are (stochastically) independent but not iid.

***Collective risk model:*** is a model where we study the aggregate risk(loss) $S = X_{1} +...+ X_{N}$ where the risks(losses) {$X_{1}, X_{2}, ...$} are (stochastically) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and where N is a discrete random variable (called frequency) indicating the number of risks(losses), and that the $X_{i}’s$ are independent of N. 

The distribution of N is called the primary distribution and the common distribution of $X_{i}’s$ is called the secondary distribution. 

The collective model is a special case of compound distribution in which we add up a random number of identically distributed random variables.
In an individual risk model, n is the number of locations and X_{i} is the impact size for the location i. So under this model we can have $P (X_{i} = 0) > 0$ , i.e. there is positive chance that the location i will not have any impact in the period of study. 

But in the collective model, N represents the variable number of impacts and $X_{i}$ denotes the i-th amount of the impact that has occurred. 

So , under the collective model we have $P (X_{i} = 0) = 0.$
Convention: For N = 0 we set S = 0.


##6.3 Emperical study 

Emperically we can conclude based on the collected  data at each location overtime T that the probability of incidences at location i $$p_{i}=\frac{Total\ Incidences \ at \ location\ i}{Total\ incidences\ on \ the \ supply \ chain}$$


The product of the probability of incidence at location i and the average severity at location i gives us a great measure of the risk associated to loaction i.


The sum of those measures give us the expected exposure or risk on the chain during that defined period T


We can classify locations rate of risk by defined a threshold $\tau$ where depending on the ratio of 
$$\frac {p_{i}.severity_{i}} {total\ severity \ in \ chain}$$

  compare to $\tau$ we have Low, Medium , High risks indexes(or Value at Risk).






![Frequency and Impact](Pict3.png)






###Sample data for few locations

###For each location (location could mean locality also:a city,country or continent...) we summarized the past data and used it to estimate the average risk and the variation of the risk in  term of incidence numbers and impacts on the company revenue
